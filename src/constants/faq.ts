		title: 'How is Tessel 2 different from other development boards?',
		content:
			"Tessel 2 is designed for the fastest possible path to production. Plug and play modules and high-level APIs set it apart from most other development boards. Tessel doesn't expect you to set up and maintain a Linux system or track down pinout diagrams to wire up sensors (though the root shell and GPIO access are available should you desire them).",

		title: 'Can I use my own USB devices?',
		content:
